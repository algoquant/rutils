\title{Recursively \sQuote{\code{rbind}} a list of objects, such as \emph{xts} time
series.}
\usage{
do_call_rbind(listv)
}
\arguments{
\item{\code{listv}}{A list of objects, such as \emph{vectors}, \emph{matrices},
\emph{data frames}, or \emph{time series}.}
}
\value{
A single \emph{vector}, \emph{matrix}, \emph{data frame}, or
  \emph{time series}.
}
\description{
Recursively \sQuote{\code{rbind}} a list of objects, such as \emph{xts} time
series.
}
\details{
Performs lapply loop, each time binding neighboring elements and
  dividing the length of \code{listv} by half. The result of performing
  \code{do_call_rbind(list_xts)} on a list of \emph{xts} time series is
  identical to performing \code{do.call(rbind, list_xts)}. But
  \code{do.call(rbind, list_xts)} is very slow, and often causes an
  \sQuote{out of memory} error.

  The function \code{do_call_rbind()} performs the same operation as
  \code{do.call(rbind, listv)}, but using recursion, which is much faster and
  uses less memory. This is the same function as
  \sQuote{\code{\link[qmao]{do.call.rbind}}} from package
  \sQuote{\href{https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1113}{qmao}}.

\examples{
# Create xts time series
xtsv <- xts(x=rnorm(1000), order.by=(Sys.time()-3600*(1:1000)))
# Split time series into daily list
list_xts <- split(xtsv, "days")
# rbind the list back into a time series and compare with the original
identical(xtsv, rutils::do_call_rbind(list_xts))
